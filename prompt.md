# group project for me2073

This project is going to be to create a social networking site targeted at student dorm residents on campus. The idea is to connect providers of goods and services, with people in need of those goods and services. Think a combination of fiverr and ebay, but only connecting people in the immediate community. Sustainability and reduction of waste are top of mind motivations for this product.

High level considerations:
- develop using a tdd framework
- create a TODO.md, and alway decompose all planned tasks and add them to the todo for tracking
- python for backend, react for frontend
- this is a group project so lets setup for pushing to git right away, with all claude related files in the git ignore

## initial framework and requirements

### frontend

#### web
- the main page is a map, representing all currently available postings, with the right fourth of the page being a feed of cards for all postings

### backend
- mongo db to contain all users and postings.

### API
- to connect backend with frontend

### dev
- scripts to generate dummy users and posts for testing, dev and pitching
